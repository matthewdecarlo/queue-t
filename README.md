## Say Hello to Queue-t
> Queue-t is the cutest little queuing app there is.  Queue-t is designed to help teachers better answer students questions.  In settings such as labs, homework, and individual study there are often times where students will have similar questions.
> 
> The core of Queue-t is it's ability to check if questions are similar and suggest to the students and teacher that they combine 70% matches.  This would then allow the teacher to do a deep dive with the students who are having trouble with the same question.
> 
> Queue-t takes students' questions and queues them for the teacher, assuring that questions are answered in a fair order.  Student's have the ability to mark how much they are struggling with a question if the 'frustration level' is high enough, Queue-t alerts the teacher to quickly assist and alleviate the frustration.
